Maven Plugin allows you to integrate a SchemaCrawler report of your database within the 
Maven-generated website for your project.

See [an example Maven project that shows how to use the SchemaCrawler Report Maven Plugin](https://github.com/schemacrawler/SchemaCrawler-Report-Maven-Plugin-Usage-Example).
